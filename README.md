# Customer Intelligence models.

Start with the CustomerIntelligence.ipynb notebook, which has some cases where this data may be used.
The CollaborativeFiltering.ipynb contains the model training for a product recommendation engine.

In order to run the notebook, you will need to extract the data into a folder called data.
It should have the following structure.
root/
-- data/
  -- transaction.csv
  -- customer.csv
-- CustomerIntelligence.ipynb
-- CollaborativeFiltering.ipynb
